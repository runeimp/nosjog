NOSJoG v0.1.0
=============

In other words "Go JSON". Yes, I know. So very, very clever. Thank you, thank you.

This is mostly a wrapper for [Pretty][] by Josh Baker AKA tidwall. Also includes a JSON Marshaler that does not HTML encode the data. This helps for output to the terminal and should not be used for processing JSON that will be used online.
